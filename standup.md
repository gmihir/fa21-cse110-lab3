# Standup Meeting Notes

We will go around and ask everyone the following questions:

### What did you work on yesterday?
Ex: Yesterday, I worked on the home page and added some CSS to the navigation bar.


### What are you working on today?
Ex: Today, I will continue to work on the home page and work on connecting to the backend.

### Are any issues blocking you?
Ex: I am waiting for the wireframe to be returned from the design team so I cannot finish the home page today.
